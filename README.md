# An Interactive Leaflet Map Template

A fun project to design an embedded interactive map with a few add-in's for potential business cases (e.g. Lyme disease). This is a template that could be used with any data where found fit.

## Fun testing/add-in's
* Basemap changes when a user zooms in (works with Leaflet 1.0.0 +)  
* Test `L.imageOverlay` in Leaflet  

## Embedding the Map
To embed the map on a page add in the following HTML content to the page:

```html
<iframe src="http://geospatialem.github.io/leaflet-interactive-template" frameborder="0" width="600" height="400"></iframe>   
```
